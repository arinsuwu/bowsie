___Non-OW Revolution___
- __Katrina__: this system actually works now LOL


BOWSIE v1.10 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1
---
### Features
- The tool now pauses after an error or when sprites insert successfully... [Turns out regular people run BOWSIE from outside the console just like they'd do PIXI huh](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/086/808/90f.gif)

___OW Revolution___
- Upgraded to Overworld Revolution v1.1.1.
- `slots` can now be up to 32 when using `owrev`, without needing to disable RAM checks.
  - Due to this, some tables have moved RAM address locations.
- `owrev` now inserts its main handler at the pointer located at `$0480D2` instead of overwriting OW Revolution code.
- `owrev` now hacks `$02A861` directly for sprite load instead of overwriting OW Revolution code.
- Added the sprite table `!ow_sprite_props`, corresponding to OW Revolution's `!RAM_SMW_OWSpr_Properties`. It's used to know when to process an sprite even if it's offscreen. Due to overworld map sizes, it's pretty necessary.
  - Updated `%sub_offscreen()` to account for this fact.
- Removed BOWSIE pointers for previously overwritten functions.
- The bank 4 freespace finder now stops if we reach BOWSIE's default area. This is done in advance of potential future OW Revolution upgrades, as to know when to update the `JSR : NOP` to an `autoclean JSL`.
- Special thanks to yoshifanatic for all his support to make this update possible. ðŸ˜ƒ

Overworld Revolution support can now be considered mature.

___Non-OW Revolution___
- __Katrina__: added `!bowsie_contiguous` so the user can tell when a sprite is using contiguous sprite tables, like Katrina's system does.
  - Updated `%spawn_sprite()` to account for this fact.

The following features apply to both VLDC9 and Katrina's systems.
- Separated the main sprite handler into its own separate function.
- Sprites now appear during fade-in instead of awkwardly appearing out of nowhere.
### Fixes
- __OW Revolution__: now the extension bytes are set for all 256 sprites with extra bit 1, instead of just the first hundred. Oops!
- __VLDC9/Katrina__: fixed RAM addresses not clearing on level load. This was very noticeable with, eg. Yoshi spawning turning around.
- Changed `warnpc` to `assert pc()` and removed `math pri off`, in advance of Asar 2.0.
- Fixed an issue where BOWSIE couldn't find the ASM and sprite directory when calling the tool using relative paths.

BOWSIE v1.03
---
### Features
- Added the `%distance()` shared subroutine, used in VLDC9 sprites to get the absolute positional difference between the player and a sprite.
- Modified `%interact()` so it accounts for player 2 as well.
- The list file can now contain blank lines.
- The list file can now contain _comment lines_, which are lines that begin with a semicolon `;`.
### Fixes
- Fixed various bugs which were causing incorrect sprite Map16 generation:
  - The generator was miscounting when using 16x16 tiles. This was most noticeable when using json files which defined more than 1 16x16 tile.
  - Y flip was being ignored.
  - Priority was using two bits instead of one. I forget Map16 data is _YXPCCCTT_, and not _YXPPCCCT_... [silly me](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/086/808/90f.gif).
- Fixed an anomaly regarding some spawn X positions due a rogue carry in the VLDC9 system.
- Fixed a bug with `%get_draw_info()` where carry, set when off-screen, was being lost when asking for priority, making sprites get drawn even when off-screen.
- Now the sprite spawn routine clears the init state flag.
- Made the VLDC9 system read the pointer directly from ROM instead of using an Asar read. This _should_ fix issues related to crashing when not re-running the tool, at the expense of three bytes and some cycles. Thanks go to Thomas/kaizoman for suggesting this alternative!

Note that since OW Revolution support is still immature, I'm not pushing the version number to v1.10 yet.

BOWSIE v1.02
---
### Features
- Added experimental support for yoshifanatics' Overworld Revolution. Note that the tool will attempt to detect the patch on its own.\
The following additions are all related to this above feature:
  - Added the `owrev` sprite system, which modifies yoshifanatic's system with a variant of Lui's system. It's included at `owrev.asm`.
  - Added reads in the tool to find the current freespace in bank 4, where BOWSIE installs some of its code, and the routine `SMW_ProcessOWPlayers_DrawOverworldPlayerAndBorderSprites`, as the original jump is overwritten.
  - Added an `RTL` at `$04FFFF` so the uninserted sprites have a correct pointer.
  - Note that for now, overworld sprite Map16 data is still generated instead of regular sprite Map16. This will be corrected at a later date.
  - Note that the shadow drawing routine from OW Revolution is erased.
  - Note that _BOWSIE_ won't remove OW Revolution's shared subroutines, wasting space.
  - Note that this replaces yoshifanatic's own sprites with _BOWSIE_'s! Don't insert sprites with OW Revolution.
- This support is extremely experimental. Once it has been tested properly, the version number will be pushed to 1.10.

BOWSIE v1.01
---
### Features
- Moved back the OAM priority further so sprites which need priority can actually go behind the player.
- Added the shared subroutine `%get_ow_tile()`, which a sprite can call to get the index to the 16x16 tile the sprite is currently on, via a call to `$049885`. This routine is commonly used by carol's sprites.
### Fixes
- Fixed an issue in the VLDC9 system where the player's graphics routine, which in the vanilla game runs _after the sprites_, could overwrite certain sprite tiles, if the user didn't ask priority from `%get_draw_info()`. This happens whether _OPSE_ is used or not.
- Fixed an issue where `%get_draw_info()` was always writing the next OAM index to `!ow_sprite_oam`. This caused conflicts when using sprites with and without priority calls at the same time.
- Fixed an issue where BOWSIE failed to find the relevant directories when calling the tool from the command line as an absolute path. Thanks to Stivi for reporting this!
